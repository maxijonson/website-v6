# Website V6

This is the 6th version of [my personal website](https://www.chintristan.io/) (and hopefully the last one!).

The motivation behind this version was to go all-in and try a whole lot of new technologies and tools that I had never (or barely) used before. This includes:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for static site generation.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment.
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) for content management.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as a component library (I know! not exactly a "component" library, but you get it! ðŸ™„).

Sanity was one of the main motivators, as a CMS is something I had never used before but have always been curious about!
