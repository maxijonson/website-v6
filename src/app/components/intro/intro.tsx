              I'm a Web developer with a bachelor's degree in Software
              Engineering, located in Montreal, Quebec. Since I was introduced
              to programming, I've always had a passion for Web development and
              technologies, especially in the JavaScript (TypeScript) ecosystem.
              I like to try out the latest popular libraries and frameworks to
              make great software!
            </p>
            <p className={cn("text-center text-lg", "md:text-left md:text-xl")}>
              Other than development, a huge Star Wars fan! I've seen all of the
              movie and series... a couple of times! My favorite Jedi has to be
              Ahsoka Tano, for her unique fighting style and wisdom. I also
              mostly listen to EDM music. While I listen to many artists in the
              genre, my favorite is Illenium, with his great vocal chops!
            </p>
            <p className={cn("text-center text-lg", "md:text-left md:text-xl")}>
              Finally, I have a sweet spot for 4-legged fluffy friends,
              especially dogs. I'm the kind of person to hang out with the dog
              at a party. I also have a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier named
              Kingsley!
